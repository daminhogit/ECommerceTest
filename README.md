# ECommerceTest

Here I am testing the functionality of an ECommerce Demo Website using Test Scenarios manually designed.
ECommerce website www.tutorialsninja.com/demo/

I am using Selenium (java) to automate the tests on a chrome browser using Eclipse IDE. 
First test case scenarios "Login.java" involves verifying the login functionality and validating the success of user's login (.isDisplayed)
Also, I verified logging into the Application using invalid credentials (i.e. Invalid email address and Invalid Password) to see the web app response.
